### YouTube

- My Vlog [#OneStepAtATime](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9epbd8UeXHs0yqWEGv6eVuJimFyouEpf) — I'm starting the show « **One Step at a Time**» as I realize that I still have a good 50 years in front of me. I want to **share my personnal journey** as I believe it's gonna be an outstanding one. It's also to remind myself that when I'm impatient, life is not about the destination, it's about
  the journey.
- The [#AskMeAboutYourWebsite](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9epbd8UeXHtRu7WI4aK4RKDCThMf7-8Q) show — I'm **documenting FirePress's journey** for the next 10 years. This is a place where I allow myself to go deep into our vision of building an outstanding website.
