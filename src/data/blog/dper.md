Après [[repost]](/blog/repost/) et [FollowFi](/blog/followfi/), je commence les premiers élans de ma troisième startup. Cette fois-ci, tout sera en anglais puisqu'il est pénible de développer dans les deux langues.

## What is Dper?

Dper is a social networking app, topic driven where FAMO chats (Fun, Authentic, Meaningful, Open) between people are the norm, not the exception.

## Goal

Let's start with the end in mind: the goal is to build a solid business. Dper is the third startup I'm bootstrapping, and I feel confident to deliver the vision, the guidance and the level of execution needed to make it happen. The route is simple, but hard to execute. I'm not kidding myself here... I will suffer.

## Roadmap

I track the high-level steps to accomplish (and almost everything) in Trello. It looks like this:

- Put some high-level concepts on paper (this blog)
- Find the right people that [share the same vision](/blog/each-day-traditional-social-networks-are-disconnecting-from-you/) about traditional social networks
- Of all ideas and possibilities, define things that are in-scope (therefore out of scope) for the MVP
- Execute the MVP 0.1
- Learn [the lean way](/blog/the-lean-way-to-start-something/)
- Grow the user base
- Learn, readjust, focus and release the next MVP
- All of this while having fun doing it :)
